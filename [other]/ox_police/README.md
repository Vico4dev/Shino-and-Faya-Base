# ox_police (experimental)
**For ox_core only**

Not planning on creating many jobs, but police is fairly important. Ambulance is another future consideration.  
This should serve as an example for creating jobs, and you're encouraged to make your own.


### Notes
- Evidence lockers and armouries are handled by ox_inventory.
- Boss menu and vehicle spawning should be handled through ox_lib's new menu component.
- Markers, notifications, etc. should be built around ox_lib's zones module (spheres should usually be enough).


If you have suggestions, post a new issue.  
If you want to PR a feature you should ask first (so you won't waste time).
